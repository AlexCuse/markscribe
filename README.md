# markscribe

Your personal markdown scribe with template-engine and Git(Hub) & RSS powers ðŸ“œ

In order to access GitHub's API, markscribe expects you to provide a valid
GitHub token as an environment variable called `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Usage

Render a template to stdout:

    markscribe file.tpl

Render to a file:

    markscribe -write /tmp/output.md file.tpl

## Templates

You can find an example template to generate a GitHub profile README under
`templates/github-profile.tpl`. Make sure to fill in the placeholders, like
the RSS-feed or social media URLs.

Rendered it looks a little like my own profile page: https://github.com/muesli

## Template Engine

markscribe uses Go's powerful template engine. You can find its documentation
here: https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/
